OpenShift VM

Helps if you have Virtualbox and Vagrant already installed, but this attempts to install those for you.

```
pip install shutit
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ianmiell/shutit-openshift-vm
cd shutit-openshift-vm
./walkthrough.sh # to pause and let you interact while it's building
./run.sh # to run through the lot without pausing
```
